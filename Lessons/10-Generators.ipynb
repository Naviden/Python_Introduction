    "# Generators in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators are a simple way of creating iterators in Python. They do so by allowing you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator, i.e., it can be used in a `for` loop. Generators are written just like a normal function but use the `yield` statement whenever they want to return data. Each time `next()` is called on it, the generator resumes where it left off (it remembers all the data values and which statement was last executed).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Generators?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory Efficient**: A normal function to return a sequence will create the entire sequence in memory before returning the result. A generator instead produces one value at a time, which is more memory efficient.\n",
    "- **Represent Infinite Stream**: Generators are excellent for working with data streams or sequences that are too large to fit in memory or are infinite.\n",
    "- **Composable into Pipelines**: For large data flows, you can easily compose generators into a pipeline, each generator processing a piece of data at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Create a Generator?\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a generator in Python is as simple as defining a normal function with a `yield` statement instead of a `return` statement. If a function contains at least one `yield` statement, it becomes a generator function."

    "## Why you should use generators?\n",
    "Using generators instead of lists can be advantageous in several scenarios, primarily due to the differences in memory usage and performance between the two. Here's when you might prefer generators over lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Handling Large Data Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with very large data sets, using a list to store all elements in memory can be highly inefficient or even impossible due to memory constraints. Generators, on the other hand, generate items on the fly and consume memory only for the item that is currently being processed. This makes generators a better choice for large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario**: Processing records from a large file line by line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Representing Infinite Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators can model infinite sequences or streams of data, which is something lists cannot do. Since generators produce items only as needed, you can have a generator that yields an infinite sequence without running out of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario**: Generating an infinite sequence of prime numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Improving Performance in Pipelined Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators can improve performance when pipelining operations. Since a generator processes one item at a time, you can start processing the first few items of the sequence without having to wait for the entire sequence to be generated. This can lead to performance gains in scenarios where later processing stages do not need to wait for the full dataset to be available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario**: Applying a series of transformations to each item in a dataset, where each transformation is represented as a generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Lazy Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators are evaluated lazily, meaning they generate values only when asked. This is useful when you have a computation-heavy operation and you want to delay execution until itâ€™s absolutely necessary, or when you might not need all the items.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario**: You're querying a database and might only need the first few results out of thousands based on some condition that you check during iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Saving Memory in Concurrency\n",
    "\n",
    "In scenarios where memory usage is a concern, such as applications running on resource-constrained devices or when implementing concurrency where each task requires its own dataset, generators can significantly reduce the memory footprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario**: Concurrent network crawlers that process URLs from a stream of incoming data."
