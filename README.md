# Introduction to Python

I have created this notebook for the _Introduction to Python_ course at the _University of Milano-Bicocca_, as part of the _Business Intelligence and Big Data Analytics_ program. This course aims to familiarize students who have no prior knowledge of Python or programming in general with the basics of Python.

## About This Course

This introductory course is designed to provide an overview of the Python programming language and its fundamental structure. As Python is the principal programming language for future modules in the Master's program, such as web scraping, machine learning, and text mining, it's essential to have a basic understanding of it. Please note that due to Python's vast array of features and tools, we cannot cover everything in this course. The objective here is not to turn you into Python programmers but to introduce you to its basics, enabling you to expand your data science skills using this modern programming language.

## Structure

Our goal is not to offer an in-depth insight into Python or act as an official reference, as there are numerous online resources available for detailed learning. We assume no prior knowledge of programming or data analysis, given the diverse backgrounds of our students. This course includes simple examples to clearly illustrate the functionality of different tools. Additionally, there are sections titled "YOUR TURN," which encourage you to apply what you have learned. These sections are marked with symbols indicating the difficulty level of the exercises:

- _EASY_: These exercises are expected to be solved independently. (max 2 min)

- _So-So_: If you find these challenging, consider discussing them with a peer. (max 5 min)

- _HARD_: If these exercises seem too difficult, don't worry. Try tackling them again at home!

For exercises requiring code, you'll find a placeholder code block with a Python symbol. Simply replace it with your answer.

While most code parts are self-explanatory, some require more detailed explanations. These are indicated by an owl symbol.

All the notebooks can be found in the "Lessons" directory, categorized by topic.
