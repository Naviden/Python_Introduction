### Case Study 1: Data Analysis with CSV Files
**Objective:** Analyze sales data to generate insights.

1. **Task:** Read a CSV file containing sales data with columns like `Date`, `Product`, `Quantity Sold`, `Price`, and `Total Sale`.
2. **Dataset:** [Kaggle Superstore Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)
3. **Steps:**
   - Load the CSV file using the `csv` or `pandas` library.
   - Calculate the total sales for each product.
   - Identify the top 5 products with the highest sales.
   - Find the total sales for each month.
   - Plot the monthly sales data using `matplotlib`.

### Case Study 2: Text Processing and Analysis
**Objective:** Analyze a text document for word frequency.

1. **Task:** Read a text file and perform text analysis.
2. **Dataset:** [Gutenberg Project Text Files](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342) (e.g., "Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen)
3. **Steps:**
   - Load the text file.
   - Clean the text by removing punctuation and converting it to lowercase.
   - Tokenize the text into words.
   - Count the frequency of each word.
   - Identify the top 10 most common words.
   - Plot a bar chart of the top 10 most common words using `matplotlib`.

### Case Study 3: Web Scraping
**Objective:** Extract and analyze data from a website.

1. **Task:** Scrape data from a website (e.g., news articles, product reviews).
2. **Dataset:** [IMDB Movie Reviews](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/)
3. **Steps:**
   - Choose a website and identify the data to be scraped.
   - Use `requests` to fetch the web page content.
   - Use `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML and extract data.
   - Store the extracted data in a structured format (e.g., CSV).
   - Analyze the data, such as counting the number of articles/reviews or identifying the most common words.

### Case Study 4: Working with APIs
**Objective:** Retrieve and analyze data from a public API.

1. **Task:** Use a public API to retrieve data (e.g., weather data, stock prices).
2. **Dataset:** [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for weather data.
3. **Steps:**
   - Choose a public API and understand its documentation.
   - Use the `requests` library to fetch data from the API.
   - Parse the JSON response.
   - Store the data in a CSV file.
   - Perform analysis, such as finding the average temperature for a week or the highest stock price for a month.

### Case Study 5: Numerical Computations
**Objective:** Perform numerical computations and visualizations.

1. **Task:** Analyze a dataset (e.g., population growth, stock prices).
2. **Dataset:** [World Bank Population Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)
3. **Steps:**
   - Load the dataset using `numpy` or `pandas`.
   - Perform basic statistical analysis (mean, median, standard deviation).
   - Plot the data using `matplotlib` (e.g., line plot of population growth over time).
   - Fit a trend line or perform regression analysis if applicable.

### Case Study 6: Automation Script
**Objective:** Automate a repetitive task.

1. **Task:** Create a script to automate sending emails or renaming files.
2. **Dataset:** [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/) for generating dummy email addresses.
3. **Steps:**
   - For email automation: Use the `smtplib` and `email` libraries to send emails.
     - Collect email addresses from the Random User Generator API.
     - Send personalized emails to each recipient.
   - For file renaming: Use the `os` library to rename multiple files in a directory.
     - Read the file names from a directory.
     - Apply a naming convention and rename the files.
