# Practical Python Projects for Undergraduate Students

This document outlines a series of practical Python projects designed to enhance the applied skills of undergraduate students. Each project focuses on a key area of data analysis, from data cleaning to predictive modeling, using real-world datasets to provide hands-on experience.

## 1. Data Manipulation and Cleaning: COVID-19 Data Cleanup

**Objective:** Improve skills in data cleaning and manipulation using `pandas` and `numpy`.

**Description:** You will work with raw COVID-19 case data: clean missing values, correct data types, and merge datasets from different sources to prepare for analysis.

**Dataset:** COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University  
**URL:** [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 GitHub](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

**Key Skills:**
- Handling missing values
- Data type conversions
- Merging and concatenating datasets

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): E-commerce Sales Analysis

**Objective:** Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies.

**Description:** Using an e-commerce sales dataset, you will create visualizations to understand customer behavior, seasonal trends, and product performance.

**Dataset:** "E-Commerce Data" (Actual transactions from a UK retailer)  
**URL:** [Kaggle E-Commerce Data](https://www.kaggle.com/carrie1/ecommerce-data)

**Key Skills:**
- Data visualization with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Descriptive statistics
- Identifying patterns and trends in data

## 3. Statistical Modeling and Hypothesis Testing: Analyzing Student Performance

**Objective:** Apply statistical tests to analyze data and draw conclusions from hypotheses.

**Description:** You will use statistical tests to explore the relationship between study hours and grades among students, including group performance comparisons.

**Dataset:** "Student Performance Data Set"  
**URL:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Student Performance](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance)

**Key Skills:**
- Performing t-tests and ANOVA
- Interpreting p-values
- Understanding the assumptions of statistical tests

## 4. Predictive Modeling: Predicting House Prices

**Objective:** Build and evaluate regression models for predictive analysis.

**Description:** You will develop a model to predict house prices based on various features, such as location and size, and evaluate its performance.

**Dataset:** "House Sales in King County, USA"  
**URL:** [Kaggle House Sales in King County, USA](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)

**Key Skills:**
- Regression analysis with `scikit-learn`
- Model evaluation and validation
- Feature selection and engineering

## 5. Time Series Analysis: Stock Market Trend Analysis

**Objective:** Conduct time series analysis to forecast future values and identify trends.

**Description:** you will work with historical stock price data, applying ARIMA models to predict future prices and analyze trends.

**Dataset:** Historical Stock Market Data  
**Note:** Data can be obtained from Yahoo Finance or similar platforms.  
**Suggested Method:** Use the Yahoo Finance API or download data directly for a selected company.

**Key Skills:**
- Time series decomposition
- Forecasting with ARIMA models
- Trend and seasonality analysis


## 6. Basic Text Analysis: Analyzing Online Reviews

**Objective:** Introduce basic text analysis techniques, including sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and topic modeling.

**Description:** You will work with a dataset of online product reviews. The project involves preprocessing text data, analyzing sentiment, extracting key phrases, and identifying common themes across reviews.

**Dataset:** "Amazon Fine Food Reviews"  
**URL:** [Kaggle Amazon Fine Food Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)

**Key Skills:**
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, removing stop words, stemming)
- Sentiment analysis using pre-trained models
- Keyword extraction and frequency analysis
- Basic topic modeling with LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)

### Project Steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load the dataset and perform initial exploration.
   - Clean the text data by removing HTML tags, punctuation, and non-alphanumeric characters.
   - Tokenize text and remove stop words.

2. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - Apply a pre-trained sentiment analysis model to determine the sentiment of each review.
   - Analyze the distribution of sentiment across the dataset and correlate with other variables, such as review scores.

3. **Keyword Extraction:**
   - Use frequency analysis to identify the most common words and phrases in the reviews.
   - Explore the context of these keywords to understand their significance.

4. **Topic Modeling:**
   - Implement a basic LDA model to discover the underlying topics within the reviews.
   - Interpret the topics and evaluate their coherence and relevance to the dataset.

### Learning Outcomes:
- Understand the basics of NLP and text analysis.
- Gain practical experience with Python libraries such as `nltk` for text preprocessing and `gensim` for topic modeling.
- Learn to apply sentiment analysis to derive insights from text data.
- Develop skills in interpreting the results of complex NLP tasks such as topic modeling.
